  # Overview & Planning

  Before we start here is a little write up on how I planned for this project, and what data I have gathered. 

  <div class="border p-6">
    <MarkdownSnippet
      markdown={detailsMD}
      href={`/issues/reverse-engineering`}
      cta="Read More"
    />
  </div>

  There are a few tags that are important to the Technonomicon, and `More` might be the most important of all.

  The contents of a `More` tag can be discarded, by rendering `More` as `Empty`
