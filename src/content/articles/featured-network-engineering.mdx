<FancyParagraph>
The Packet Bench issue is always expanding, but a few labs keep coming up in workshops. This article
rounds up the ones I recommend when you want to get hands on fast.
</FancyParagraph>

## Packet sniffer starter lab

Build a `pcap` reader that prints Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers. The exercise explains buffer layouts and shows how filters work under the hood.

## ICMP explorer

Craft echo requests manually, capture the responses, and measure round trip times. The lab teaches how TTL works and why traceroute is possible.

## Stealth port scan

Implement a slow SYN scanner that logs banners without triggering every IDS. We cover pacing strategies and how to validate the results with captures.

## Why these matter

* They teach fundamentals that unlock the rest of the issue.
* Each comes with captures so you can compare your output.
* They scale: start with the basics, then extend with new protocols.
