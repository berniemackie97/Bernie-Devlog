<FancyParagraph>
The Clean Room is where I document ethical hacking experiments. Every lab runs in an isolated sandbox
with evidence collection, cleanup steps, and notes you can replay later.

## What this issue covers

* Lab architecture with disposable virtual machines
* Static and dynamic reverse engineering workflows
* Social engineering drills that respect consent

## Who it helps

* Engineers who want to understand offensive techniques safely
* Security teams building training material with reproducible labs
* Curiosity driven developers looking for practical reverse engineering exercises

## Safety principles

1. Work only on assets you own or have written permission to test.
2. Store payloads and captures in restricted buckets.
3. Clean snapshots after every lab. Assume nothing is disposable until you prove it.

## Suggested starting path

1. Build the sandbox and capture your first packet traces.
2. Tackle a static malware teardown.
3. Run a small phishing simulation with leadership approval.

Each article lists prerequisites, estimated time, and the artifacts you should save. Use the notes as a template for your own reports.
