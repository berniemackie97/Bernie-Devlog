# {frontmatter.title}

We’ll learn networking by **building small tools**. Each article is a standalone lab: write it, run it against captures or a lab network, and verify what you see on the wire.

## Format
Short posts that stack. Every lab includes:
- the goal and a minimal plan,
- commands you can copy,
- a quick check to prove it worked,
- a capture or screenshot you can compare with.

## What you need
- One or two Linux VMs  
- Basic terminal usage  
- Space to capture traffic (pcap) in a **lab-only** environment

> New labs publish progressively. The full list lives on the issue page.
