<FancyParagraph>
Automation helps when it removes toil without adding mystery. This guide walks through the
questions I ask before writing a script, how I stage it from local helper to shared job, and the
checks I expect before anyone depends on it.
</FancyParagraph>

## Choose the work worth automating

* Look for tasks you repeat at least three times a week.
* Favor work with clear inputs and outputs. If you cannot write the success check, the script will fail silently.
* Start with the version that helps you. Adoption from teammates is a bonus, not the goal.

## Capture the manual path first

Write down the exact manual steps before touching a keyboard. For shell tasks I drop a short
checklist into `docs/runbooks/`.

```text
# release-hotfix.md
1. Pull the hotfix branch.
2. Run the regression suite.
3. Tag the release candidate.
4. Announce in #deployments.
```

If the checklist feels clumsy, the automation will inherit the same confusion.

## Script locally with instant feedback

Create a tiny CLI rather than a pile of copy pasted commands.

```bash
# tools/release.sh
set -euo pipefail

tag=${1:?"tag required"}
branch=${2:-main}

git fetch origin "$branch"
git checkout "$branch"
npm test
npm run build
./scripts/create-tag "$tag"
```

Run it until the output is boring. Boring is good.

## Promote to shared automation in stages

1. **Personal helper:** lives in `tools/` and only you call it.
2. **Team helper:** add docs, ask for a review, and run it during a pairing session.
3. **Scheduled job:** once it survives a few manual runs, wire it into CI with guardrails.

Each stage adds observability. Log inputs, emit a short summary, and fail loudly.

## Keep the maintenance loop tight

* Pin tool versions and check them into the repo. Implicit dependencies break at 2 AM.
* Add smoke tests. Mine run the script in `--dry-run` mode to confirm options parse and external services respond.
* Schedule a quarterly audit. Delete automation nobody uses.

## Next steps

The rest of the issue walks through concrete builds: a filesystem watcher that keeps design tokens in sync, a pull request triage bot, and a deployment pipeline with preflight checks. Start with the watcher article if you want a quick win.
