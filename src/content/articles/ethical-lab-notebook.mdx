<FancyParagraph>
A notebook is your source of truth during ethical hacking engagements. It preserves context for future
reviews, keeps leadership informed, and prevents lost indicators. This article shows what to record
and how to structure it.
</FancyParagraph>

## Pick a tooling stack

* Plain markdown files in the repo (`docs/labs/`).
* Encrypted notes with strong search (Obsidian, Notion, or your preferred tool).
* Screenshots and captures stored alongside notes.

Whatever you choose, make sure exporting to a static archive is easy.

## Template for each lab

```markdown
# Lab name

## Overview
Goal, target, and scope.

## Timeline
List timestamps for key actions.

## Evidence
Links to captures, logs, and artifacts.

## Cleanup
What changed, snapshots restored, credentials rotated.
```

## Capture while you work

Add notes during the lab rather than at the end. Short bullet points beat memory. Include command outputs, tool versions, and any anomalies you notice.

## Share responsibly

When the engagement allows it, share sanitized excerpts with stakeholders. Transparency builds trust and shows the value of the work.

## Archive when complete

1. Export the notebook to PDF or static HTML.
2. Store it with the rest of the evidence.
3. Tag it with the project name and date.

Good notes mean you never redo analysis just to remember what happened.
