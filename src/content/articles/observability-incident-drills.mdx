Instrumentation only helps when the team knows how to respond. This article sets up a cadence of
frontend incident drills, complete with runbooks, role assignments, and follow up notes.
</FancyParagraph>

## Draft the playbook

Each drill starts with a real scenario written in a runbook. Include:

* Triggering metric or alert
* Who is on point (engineer, communicator, note taker)
* Expected customer impact
* Resolution checklist

## Schedule table top drills

Run the first few drills as table top sessions. Gather in a conference room or call, walk through the runbook, and capture the gaps. Keep the tone blameless and focused on learning.

## Move to live fire

Once the team is comfortable, simulate incidents on a staging environment. Example ideas:

* Inject latency into the API responses.
* Serve outdated assets to a segment of traffic.
* Revoke a feature flag unexpectedly.

Treat the drill as seriously as production. Capture timelines, customer messaging, and follow ups.

## Closing the loop

After every drill write a short retro:

1. What signal told us something was wrong?
2. How long until we understood the blast radius?
3. Where did tooling help or slow us down?
4. Which action items will prevent the problem next time?

Store the retros next to the runbooks. Future hires learn faster when history is visible.

## Keep improving

Rotate participants so the entire team learns the workflow. Pair the drills with performance budget reviews and telemetry audits. Observability is not a tool set; it is a muscle.
