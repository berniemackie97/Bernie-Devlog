<FancyParagraph>
We will analyze a small malware sample in the lab without executing it on bare metal. The goal is to
understand capabilities, indicators, and where to focus dynamic analysis later.
</FancyParagraph>

## Prepare the sample

1. Store the file in a password protected zip (`infected.zip` with password `infected`).
2. Record hashes:
   * `sha256sum sample.exe`
   * `pehash sample.exe`
3. Document the source of the sample and the lab date.

## Run first pass tooling

* `strings sample.exe` to spot URLs, mutexes, and commands.
* `pefile` to list imports and sections.
* `detect-it-easy` (DIE) to identify packers.

Capture everything in notes so you can compare future samples.

## Build an indicator list

Create a simple table with hashes, domains, and other artifacts.

```markdown
| Indicator | Type    | Notes              |
|-----------|---------|--------------------|
| abcd1234  | Hash    | SHA256             |
| example.com | Domain | Beacon destination |
| Global\MutexName | Mutex | Prevents double run |
```

## Plan dynamic follow up

Static analysis rarely answers everything. If the sample looks packed, queue it for dynamic execution in the next lab inside a sandbox with API monitoring.

## Store and share safely

Archive the sample and notes in a restricted bucket. Never email malware. Share only with trusted teammates who are part of the exercise.
