# {frontmatter.title}

**{frontmatter.description}**

<p>This blog is themed to feel like a virtual magazine series. I will be organizing my posts into **Issues** and **Articles** q</p>
<p>You’re on **Issue {frontmatter.issue_number}**, this page serves as a sort of catalog for issues that are new or receiving new releases. </p>

## How to navigate

* In the header: **All Issues** for the full catalog  
* Inside any issue: open an article and start. Most list prerequisites, time, and difficulty up top.

## What to expect

Clear, reproducible work across ethical hacking, reverse engineering, network engineering, emulation, and developer tooling. Quick hits when you want them, deep dives when you’re ready.

## What’s an issue?

An **Issue** is a focused bundle around one topic. Active issues get new articles over time, so they’re worth revisiting.

## Stay in the loop

Check back for new releases, continue a series inside an active issue, or dig through the archive when you want something different. If an article helps, share it.
