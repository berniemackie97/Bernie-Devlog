<FancyParagraph>
Phishing drills teach employees how to spot suspicious messages. Done badly they hurt trust. This
article shows how to design a drill that is transparent, consent driven, and measurable.
</FancyParagraph>

## Align with stakeholders

* Get approval from security leadership, HR, and legal.
* Share the goals: awareness, response practice, or tooling validation.
* Announce the exercise window without giving away exact timing.

## Build the campaign

1. Create realistic but harmless lures (invoices, support requests).
2. Host landing pages on a controlled subdomain.
3. Record metadata only (timestamps, client, department). No personal content.

## Run and monitor

Use tooling such as GoPhish or a vendor service. During the exercise:

* Respond quickly when someone reports the phishing message.
* Provide positive reinforcement instead of blame.
* Capture metrics: open rate, click rate, credential submissions, and report rate.

## Share the results

Publish a post exercise summary with:

* Aggregate metrics
* What worked (teams that reported quickly)
* Improvements planned (training modules, email banners)

## Reinforce learning

Follow the drill with a voluntary workshop. Walk through real examples, show how the telemetry helped, and update the incident response checklist with lessons learned.
