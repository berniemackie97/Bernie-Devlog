# Roadmap

## Must Do
- Install dependencies locally and rerun `npm run build` (current failure: missing `astro` package in `node_modules`).
- Review new issue/article content for tone, accuracy, and add assets (screenshots, diagrams) as needed.

## Nice to Have
- Add automated content tests (e.g., check for missing fields, broken links).
- Create story-driven previews for cards or teasers using Astro view transitions.
- Expand docs with screenshots once layouts settle.
- Implement search or filtering for issues/articles as the catalog grows.

## Monitoring
- Manual visual QA on common breakpoints (mobile portrait, tablet, desktop wide).
- Keep DaisyUI theme tokens aligned with any future brand palette changes.
